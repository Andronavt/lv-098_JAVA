	<h2>Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. Poor cruel folk</h2>
	<div id="content" class="content">
		<div>The King sat naked. Like a foolish pauper on the street, he
			sat leaning against a cold wall, drawing in his blue, goose-bumped
			legs. He shivered, with his eyes closed, he listened, but everything
			was quiet.</div>
		<div>He awoke at midnight from a nightmare and immediatelly
			understood that he was finished. Some one weezed and writhed by the
			door of the bedroom suite, he heard footsteps, metalic jingling and
			drunken mummbling of His Highness, Uncle Buht: "Let me through... Let
			me.. Break it down, hell with it..." Wet with icy sweat, he slintly
			rolled off his bed, ducked into a secter closet, and loosing himself
			he ran down the underground passage. Something sqelched under his
			bare feet, the startled rats dashed away, but he did not notice
			anything, just now, sitting next to a wall he remembered everything;
			the darkness, the slippery walls, and the pain from a blow on the
			head against the shakled door to the temple, and his own unberable
			high yelp.</div>
		<div>They shall not enter here, he thought. No one shall enter
			here. Only if the King order's so. But the King shall not order... He
			snickered hysterically. Oh no, the King will not order! He carefully
			un screwed up his eyes and saw his blue, hairless legs with scraped
			knees. Still alive, he thought. I will live, because they shall not
			enter here.</div>
		<div>Everything in the temple was blueish from the cold light of
			the lanterns -- long glowing tubes that were stretched under the
			ceiling. In the center, God stood on an eminence, big, heavy, with
			sparkling dead eyes. The King continuously and stupidly stared, until
			God was suddenly screened by a shabby lay brother, still a greenhorn.
			Scraching, with an open mouth he gazed at the naked King. The King
			squinted once again. Scum, he thought, a lousy vermine, catch the
			mongrel and to the dogs, for them to ravage... He reasoned that he
			did not remember the lout well, but he was long gone. So scrawny,
			snotty... That's all right, we'll remember. We'll remeber everything,
			Your Highness, Uncle Buht. During the father's reighn, I dare say you
			sat quietly, drank a bit and kept silent, were afraid to be noticed,
			you knew that King Prostyaga did not forget you ignoble treachery...</div>
		<div>Great was the father, the King thought with an accustomed
			envy. You'd be great, if your advisors are God's angels in flesh. All
			know, all have seen them: their faces fearful, white, like milk, and
			their garment were such that one could not understand if they were
			naked or not. And their arrows were fiery, like lightning, they drove
			off the nomads with the arrows, and although they casted them
			overhead, half the horde cripled from fear. His Highness, Uncle Buht,
			wispered once upon a time, drunk and burping, that those arrows can
			be cast by anyone, that special slings are needed that the angels
			have and that would be nice to take from them. And he said then -- he
			was drunk then, -- that if it is nice to have, why not have it, why
			not... Soon after that table talk one angel fell off the wall into
			the moat, probably slipped. Next to him they found one of uncle's
			body guards with a javelin between his shoulder blades. It was a
			dark, dark deed... It good that the people did not care about the
			angels, they were scary to look at, but it is not clear why is it
			scary -- angels were happy, cordial people. Only their eyes were
			scary. Small, shiny, and they keep racing around... non humanoid
			eyes, not peaceful. So the people hushed down, although father, King
			Prostyaga gave them such freedom that it is shameful to remember...
			although, before the Coup, father, they say was a saddle maker. For
			saying so, with my own hands I had torn eyes out, and sewen ears
			shut. But I remember, he used to sit in the evenings by the Crystal
			Tower, and he would cut out leather -- beautiful work. And I would
			perch myself at his side, it's warm and comfy... The angels were
			singing from the rooms, so quietly, and in harmony, and father would
			start to accompany -- he knew their language -- it used to be
			spacious, nobody around... not like now, guards are stuck at every
			corner, but there is no sense in it...</div>
		<div>The King lamented. Yes, he was a good father, just that he
			did not die for a long time. You can't do that while your son is
			still alive... The son is also the King, the son also want's to...
			But Prostyaga did not age, I'm over fifty,and he still looks younger
			than me... It looks like the angels had asked God for his health...
			They asked for his health, but they forgot about me. They say that
			the second one they managed to pin down in the father's room, he had
			a sling in each hand, but he did not fight. Before death, they say,
			he threw both of them out the window, they burst into a blue flame,
			there was no dust left... Too bad about the slings... And Prostyaga,
			they say, cried and got drunk then, within an inch of his life -- the
			first time since his reign -- looked for me, they said, loved me,
			believed...</div>
		<div>The King drew his knees to his chin, and hugged his leggs.
			So what if he believed? One should know one's limit, abdicate, like
			it is done elsewhere... and I do not know anything, and do not want
			to. There was only a conversation with my uncle, His Highnesss.</div>
		<div>"Prostyaga, -- he said, -- doesn't age". -- "Yes, -- I tell
			him, -- but what can we do, the angels pleaded for his health." Uncle
			then sneered, scum, and wispered: "Angels, -- he said, -- no longer
			sing their songs here". And I blurted out: "It is true, but now there
			is a way to deal with them, not just with humans". Uncle looked at me
			soberly, and immediatelly left... And I didn't really say anything...
			Empty words, without meaning... And in a week Prostyaga died from a
			heart attack. So what? It was his time. He looked young, but in
			reality he was over one hundred. We'll all die...</div>
		<div>The King was startled, and covering himself, awkwardly sat
			up. Into the temple came the High Priest Agar. Lay brothers were
			leading him by the hands. He didn't look at the King, came up to God
			and kneeled in front of the eminence, tall, hunch-backed, with waist
			length dirty-white hair. The King gloated "It's the end of you, Your
			Highness, you did manage, I'm not like Prostyaga, you'll ravage your
			oun intestines, drunken swine..." Agar spoke in a rich voice:</div>
		<div>- God! The King wishes to speak to you! Forgive him and
			listen!</div>
		<div>The room fell silent, no-one dared to breathe. The King
			contemplated: when the great flood happened, and the earth burst,
			Prostyaga asked God to help, and God came down from the sky as a ball
			of flame on the same day, and that night the earth closed up, and the
			flood disappeared. It means that this is how it will happen today.
			You were late uncle, Your Highness, you didn't manage. No one can
			help you now...</div>
		<div>Agar straighned up. The lay brothers that supported him,
			jumped away, turned with their backs to God, and covered their heads
			with their arms. The Kind saw, how Agar stretced his clasped hands
			and put them on Gods chest. God's eyes lit up. The King snapped his
			jaw from fear: the eyes were big and different -- one was
			snakish-green, the other white, as bright as light. One could hear
			how God started to breathe, heavily, with crackling, like
			consumption. Agar backed away.</div>
		<div>- Speak, - he whispered. It looked like he was unsettled as
			well.</div>
		<div>The King lowered to all fours, and started to crawl to the
			eminence. He did not know what to do or how. And he did not know how
			he should start and whether he should tell the complete truth. God
			breathed heavily, weezing, suddenly he started to whimper, quietly
			and thinly - scary.</div>
		<div>- I'm the son of Prostyaga -- said the King in despair,
			smothering his face against the cold stone. -- Prostyaga died. I ask
			protection from the conspirators. Prostyaga made mistakes. He did not
			know what he was doing. I have fixed everything: calmed the people,
			became great and unatainable, like you, I gathered an army... And the
			treacherous Buht is disrupting my plans to conquer the world... He
			wants to kill me! Help me!</div>
		<div>He raised his head. God, without blinking, was looking in
			his face with green and white. God was silent.</div>
		<div>- Help me... - repeated the King. -- Help! Help! - He
			suddenly thought, that he is doing something wrong, and that God is
			indifferent towards him, and inopportunely remembered: they said, his
			father, Prostyaga, did not die from a heart attack, but was killed
			here, in the temple when the killers came in, with out asking
			permission. -- Help!.-- he screemed desperatelly. -- I'm afraid to
			die today! Help! Help!</div>
		<div>He hunched up on the stone tiles, biting his hands from an
			unbarable terror. Differently-eyed God hoarsly breathed above his
			head.</div>
		<div>- Old vermine, - said Tolya. Ernst was quiet. On the
			screen, through the sparks of static an ugly black shape of a human
			lay splattered on the floor. -- When I think, Tolya spoke again, --
			that if not for him, Alan and Derek would be alive, I want to do
			something, that you never wanted to do.</div>
		<div>Ernst shrugged his shoulders and moved to the table.</div>
		<div>- And I always think, - Tolya continued, - why didn't Derek
			shoot? He could have killed all...</div>
		<div>- He couldn't , - said Ernst.</div>
		<div>- Why couldn't he?</div>
		<div>- Have you ever tried shooting at a human being?</div>
		<div>Tolya made a wry face, but didn't say anything.</div>
		<div>- Well that's what it was, - said Ernst. -- Try to imagine
			it. It is almost as disgusting.</div>
		<div>A sorowful howl was heard from the loudspeaker. "HELP HELP
			I AM AFRAID HELP..," the auto-translater was writing.</div>
		<div>- Poor cruel folk... - said Tolya.</div>
